Let me explain how did I overcome this XSS challenge set up by the bug bounty platform Intigriti. It may be a source of inspiration for some of you during your research.

To start, let’s see the rules
------

- The challenge runs from the 23rd of May until the 29th of May, 11:59 PM CET (the challenge is therefore over at the time you read this)
- Should work on the latest version of Chrome and FireFox Should execute alert(document.domain)
- Should leverage a cross-site scripting vulnerability on challenge-0523.intigriti.io domain
- Shouldn’t be self-XSS or related to MiTM attacks
- Should require no user interaction

It’s pretty clear, all we need to do is roll up our sleeves.

Code and constraints
------

<img src="/images/xssintichall-2.png">

The challenge page is quite minimalist: an input and a submit button supposed to pop up an `alert` window containing `document.domain`.

As you can imagine, this is a challenge and it won’t be as simple as submitting its `alert()` function directly. There are bound to be **constraints**, let’s take a look at the JavaScript code:

```
(()=>{
      opener=null;
      name='';
      const xss = new URL(location).searchParams.get("xss") || '';
      const characters = /^[a-zA-Z,'+\\.()]+$/;
      const words =/alert|prompt|eval|setTimeout|setInterval|Function|location|open|document|script|url|HTML|Element|href|String|Object|Array|Number|atob|call|apply|replace|assign|on|write|import|navigator|navigation|fetch|Symbol|name|this|window|self|top|parent|globalThis|new|proto|construct|xss/i;
      if(xss.length<100 && characters.test(xss) && !words.test(xss)){  
        script = document.createElement('script');
        script.src='data:,'+xss
        document.head.appendChild(script)  
      }
      else{
        console.log("try harder");
      }
    })()
```

The code is clear and easily understandable, the xss parameter retrieves our payload and **must meet three conditions to be taken into consideration** and therefore, to be concatenated to the ‘data:,’ value of the src attribute of the newly created script tag. Let’s take a closer look at these three conditions ;

1 - The payload length must be **less than 100 characters**

```
xss.length<100 
```

2 - The “characters” constant contains a regular expression acting here as a whitelist. If our payload contains a character that is not included in the regex then **the condition will not be met**

```
const characters = /^[a-zA-Z,'+\\.()]+$/;
```

```
characters.test(xss)
```

The accepted characters are:

- Alphabetical
- The characters `+ , ( ) ‘ . \`

3 - The “words” constant here acts as a **blacklist**, if any of the words from our payload is there, **the condition will not be met**. Bad luck, these are the most interesting JavaScript keywords!

```
const words =/alert|prompt|eval|setTimeout|setInterval|Function|location|open|document|script|url|HTML|Element|href|String|Object|Array|Number|atob|call|apply|replace|assign|on|write|import|navigator|navigation|fetch|Symbol|name|this|window|self|top|parent|globalThis|new|proto|construct|xss/i;
```

If one of these conditions is not met, then the character string — motivating at the beginning, frustrating at the end — “try harder” appears in the console.

Start of investigations
------
When I first came across Intigriti’s tweet announcing the start of the challenge, a first hint had already been revealed by the team :

<img src="/images/xssintichall-3.png">

They’re cool, the hint is self-explanatory: **part of the secret is in the ECMA6 documentation**.

You don’t know what **ECMA** is? Go to your favorite search engine! In the meantime, a small definition from the Mozilla documentation:

>Ecma International (formally European Computer Manufacturers Association) is a non-profit organization that develops standards in computer hardware, communications, and programming languages.
>
>On the web it is famous for being the organization which maintain the ECMA-262 specification (aka. ECMAScript) which is the core specification for the JavaScript language. Source: developer.mozilla.org

After some time reading the docs, I think I found something useful in our case, it is **the Reflect object**, two of its methods are interesting **get** and **set**, a getter and a setter therefore. I take a look at the blacklist and it’s encouraging: the words Reflect, get and set are not there!

**How `Reflect()` works?**

The two methods we are interested in are get and set :

- `Reflect.get()` : Acts as an accessor, the first parameter is the target object, and the second parameter is the property. The method returns the value of the property in question.
- `Reflect.set()` : Acts as a setter, the first parameter is the target object, the second parameter the property to modify (or create) and the third parameter the (new) value to assign.

*Both methods have an additional optional parameter which we are not interested in here.*

Ok it’s very interesting for us and it will do the job. I spare you my many trial and error and we move on to creating the payload.

Close to the goal
------
As you could see earlier, **most of the interesting keywords are blacklisted**, but whether it’s in the context of a challenge like here or in the real world on a program, no matter how robust the security is, it’s enough an oversight or negligence to create a gaping hole in the security of the platform/website.

During my research phase, I noticed that the keyword `frames` was not blacklisted, which is very interesting because `frames` returns `window` that was initially on the list!

<img src="/images/xssintichall-4.png">

With the Window object, the first thing that came to my mind was to change the value of `location` via the “set” method of `Reflect()`.

It was a bit complicated because it was necessary to have the character colon (:) to specify the protocol (`javascript:`), but not being whitelisted (regex) **it was impossible to use it directly**. After several attempts, **I had a payload that worked but was longer than 100 characters (106!)**:

```
Reflect.set(frames,'locatio'+'n','javasc'+'ript'+origin.at('zhero'.length)+'ale'+'rt(do'+'cument.domain)')
```

- Concatenations bypass the blacklist:
`‘locatio’+’n’`,
`‘javasc’+’ript’`,
`‘ale’+’rt(do’`,
`‘cument.domain)’`

- **The `at()` method is used to retrieve the character located at the index specified in the parameter and origin returns ‘https://....'**, so the colon character (:) is at **index 5**. As the use of numbers is prohibited (whitelist), I provide a character string with a length of 5 on which I call the `length()` method so that it returns me the number that will serve as a parameter for the at() method.

Close to the goal but it does not pass for the challenge.

Winning payload
------
Change of strategy and end of the suspense: the window object — returned by “frames” — has the `alert()` method… It looks much simpler than expected. What if we used the Reflect getter to call alert via a concatenation?

```
Reflect.get(frames,'aler'+'t')(Reflect.get(frames,'docum'+'ent').domain)
```

It works, with 72 characters!

<img src="/images/xssintichall-5.png">

**A brief explanation of the payload**

- `Reflect.get(frames, ‘aler’+’t’)` ➜ retrieves the alert method from frames (and therefore from window)
- `(Reflect.get(frames, ‘docum’+’ent’).domain)` ➜ Parentheses are used to execute the `alert` method. Opening a simple alert window is not enough, you have to execute `document.domain` in it. For this, we call -again- the getter of `Reflect()` to have the “document” property of “frames” (and therefore window) then -once the property is returned- we directly access the “domain” property!

Ok the challenge is **validated**, it’s good. But what about this payload in the real world? You will agree, the victim does not have too much to worry about. Let’s see if we can do better for a **real context**.

Obsession, arbitrary XSS, and end
------

<img src="/images/xssintichall-6.png">

I managed to get an **arbitrary XSS** via a payload in the URL, for this I took advantage of the fact that **the various filters only check the “xss” parameter and not the whole URL**.

To do this, I placed a hash (anchor) in the URL containing the javascript code to be executed via `javascript:`. **The hash/anchor is not subject to filters, any javascript code can be executed without any limitation**.

The value of the “xss” parameter contains the JS code that allows you to retrieve the value of the anchor, and assign it to the `location` property of the frames object :

```
https://challenge-0523.intigriti.io/challenge/xss.html?xss=Reflect.set(frames%2C%27locatio%27%2B%27n%27%2CReflect.get(frames%2C%27locatio%27%2B%27n%27).hash.split(%27\\%27).pop())#\javascript:alert('Im finally free from my shackles, saying "javascript", "eval" and "document" doesn`t scare me anymore!')
```

<img src="/images/xssintichall-7.png">

**Explanation of the payload**

1️⃣ https://challenge-0523.intigriti.io/challenge/xss.html?xss= ➜ I think it’s clear

2️⃣ `Reflect.set(frames,’locatio’+’n’`, ➜ As explained previously we indicate that we want to assign a new value to the `location` property of `frames`

3️⃣ `Reflect.get(frames,’locatio’+’n’).hash.split(‘\\’).pop())` ➜ This part is the third parameter of the “set” method of `Reflect()`, so it will be the value to assign. It will allow us to retrieve the value of the anchor in the URL:

We start by retrieving `location` via the Reflect getter, then we access “hash” which retrieves the `#` in the URL followed by the fragment identifier of the URL.

I used a backslash `\` between the `#` character and my payload to act as a separator. I just have to use the `split` method followed by the `pop` method **to get the part that interests me**.

4️⃣ `#\javascript:alert(‘Im finally free from my shackles, saying “javascript”, “eval” and “document” doesn`t scare me anymore!’)` ➜ The anchor, followed by `javascript:` and the code to execute. As explained earlier it is possible to execute anything there without character limit. **The fragment is not being checked by the various filters**.

It was my first Intigriti challenge, I enjoyed it. My write-up has been selected and I am one of the three winners, thanks to Intigriti.
